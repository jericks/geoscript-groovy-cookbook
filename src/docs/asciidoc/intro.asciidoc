== Introduction

GeoScript is a geospatial library written in Groovy. It provides modules
for working with geometries, projections, features, layers, rasters, styles, rendering, and tiles.
It is built on top of the Java Topology Suite (JTS) and GeoTools libraries.

The GeoScript Groovy Cookbook contains short recipes showing how to use the GeoScript Groovy.
