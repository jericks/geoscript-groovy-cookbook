      <abstract>A digital adaptation of the hard-copy Viking Orbiter-based geologic maps of Mars. The western equatorial region was originally mapped by David H. Scott and K. L. Tanaka (USGS I-1802-A, 1986, 1:15M scale). The eastern equatorial region was originally mapped by Ronald Greeley and J. E. Guest (USGS I-1802-B, 1987, 1:15M scale). The north and south polar regions were originally mapped by K. L. Tanaka and D. H. Scott (USGS I-1802-C, 1987, 1:15M scale). A conference abstract submitted to the 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference outlines and discusses the rationale and methodology for the digitized version presented herein. The rabstract eference is: Skinner, J. A., Jr, T. M. Hare, and K. L. Tanaka 2006, LPSC XXXVII, abstract #2331.</abstract>
      <purpose>The digital product presented herein is an adaptation. In support of ongoing scientific analysis and in advance of renewed global geologic mapping efforts, we have digitized the Viking-based Atlas of Mars, 1:15,000,000 Geologic Series (AMG) maps (USGS I-1802A-C) originally published in 1986 and 1987.</purpose>

            <edomvd>Extensive in northern lowlands where it forms moderately to lightly cratered, generally smooth plains; several isolated occurrences in cratered highlands. Conical hills or knobs occur at irregular intervals; mare-type (wrinkle) ridges locally present. Where adjacent to undivided material (unit HNu), units are gradational, but knobs in knobby plains unit are smaller and psaced farther apart. Type area: lat 22&#194;&#176;N, long 263&#194;&#176;. Interpretation: Probably of diverse origins but appears to have formed mainly by erosion of older uits. Knobs are probably erosional remnants but some may be volcanic.

Composite age of deposits uncertain. Interpretation: deposits of mixed ice and dust. Lihgt and dark layering caused by variation in dust-to-ice ratio; reflects long-term climate changes. Unconformities attributed to alternating periods of erosion and deposition that vary from place to place or to glacial stages. I-1802-C (south pole): Smooth, sparsely cratered, moderate-albedo material that forms Planum Australe; in paces characterized by alternating light and dark layers tens of meters thick; complete sequence as much as 3 km thick. Cut by curvilinear to irregular scarps and troughs, which include Chasma Australe; underlying terrain at base of troughs unscarred. Interpretation: Ice and dust deposits; albedo layering related to ice content that, in turn, depends on climate. Some scarps and troughs carved by prevailing wind patterns; others possibly formed by glacial surge. Lack of etching in underlying terrain indicates relative softness of layered material.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Multiple definitions. I-1802-A: Major occurrences cover an area of about 4,000,000 km2 extending from Solis Planum to Tempe Fossae. Characterized by broad planar surfaces with flow lobes visible in places and long, parallel, linear to sinuous mare-type (wrinkle) ridges; ridges about 30 to 70 km apart. Type area: Lunae Planum, lat 10&#194;&#176; N., long 65&#194;&#176;. Interpretation: Extensive flows of low viscosity lava erupted from many sources at high rates; ridges either volcanic constructs or compressional features.. I-1802-B: Characterized by broad planar surfaces, rare lobate deposits, and long, parallel, linear to sinuous mare-type (wrinkle) ridges about 30 to 70 km apart. Forms plains within and outside craters throughout plateau area and lowland plains north of Orcus Patera (near eat map border). Locally gradational with ride plateau material (unit Nplr) where units adjoin. Type area: Lunae Planum, lat 10&#194;&#176; N., long 65&#194;&#176; (Scott and Tanaka, 1986). Interpretation: extensive lava flows erupted with low effective viscosity from many sources at high rates; ridges either volcanic constructs or compressional features. I-1802-C: Forms broad, planar, moderately cratered surfaces marked by long, linear to sinuous ridges resembling those on lunar maria; ridges commonly several kilometers wide and tens of kilometers long.

            <edomvd>Multiple definitions. I-1802-A: Three types- (1) (1) In Valles Mariners and other chasmata as rotational slide deposits from canyon walls; surfaces hummocky near crown scarp; distal parts commonly lobate, longitudinally striated, with long runout. Type area: lat 9&#194;&#176; S., long 72&#194;&#176;. Interpretation: Gas- or water-lubricated slides and debris flows. (2) (2) Mostly on northwest flanks of Olympus Mons and largest volcanoes of Tharsis Montes as fanlike corrugated sheets as wide as 600 km that appear to override topographic obstacles without deflection of internal structure; source areas hummocky, contain small hills and circular depressions. Type area: lat 5&#194;&#176; S., long 125&#194;&#176;. Interpretation: Volcanic-debris avalanches resulting from either slope failure of explosive volcanism; alternatively, may be recessional moraines of former local ice caps. (3) (3) Along scarps of Charitum Montes and Mareotis Fossae as smooth, sloping aprons with steep, high edges. No specific type area. Interpretation: Debris aprons produced by mass-wasting and slow, glacierlike flow of ice-rich plateau material. I-1802-B: Smooth to lobate flow material associated with some scarps and crater rims; especially well developed along channel walls in Deuteronilus Mensae region. Forms aprons along scarps and around knobs and mesas; may completely cover channel floors. Primarily equivalent to third type of slide material mapped by Scott and Tanaka (1986). No specific type area. Interpretation: Unconsolidated material, such as debris flows, resulting from mass wasting. I-1802-C: Lobate, high-albedo, striated, and uncratered slope deposits extending 5 to 10 km from massifs in southern Argyre Planitia. Interpretation: Aprons of ice and debris eroded from highland terrain; emplaced by gelifluction, creep, or glacial flow.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Multiple definitions. I-1802-A: Forms hills and small knobs adjacent to highland lowland boundary scarp that extend almost to north map border. Also forms walls and interior mountains in Valles Marineris and associated canyons and channels, as well as hummocky terrain and scarps along edges of Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae. No specific type area. Interpretation: Erosional remnants and exposures of plateau sequence, highly deformed terrains materials, ancient crater rims, and some other materials that are older than surrounding rock units. I-1802-B: Forms closely spaced, conical hills a few kilometers across whose distribution indicates that they are remnants of nuerous craters. Unit also forms rugged terrain on margins of cratered plateaus and isolated remnants (as west of Orcus Patera near east map border). Gradational with knobby plains material (unit Apk) where units adjoin, but hills are more densely spaced, larger, and occupy more than about 30 percent of area. No specific type area. Interpretation: Most hills are eroded remnants of ancient cratered terrain produced by mass-wasting processes, possible as result of removal of ground ice; some hills may be erosional remnants of intrusive bodies (Greeley and Guest, 1978). Material may include some units of plateau sequence. I-1802-C (north pole): Forms high-standing hills and irregular mesas several to more than 10 km across; largest exposures make up Scandia Colles and rims of large craters nearby. Resembles knobby member of Vastitas Borealis Formation but hills generally larger and more closely spaced. Interpretation: Remnants of ancient highland material projecting above plains; heavily eroded by mass wasting. I-1802-C (south pole): Rough, massive deposits exposed in walls and floors of large, irregular pits as much as a kilometer deep at Angusti and Sisyphi Cavi; forms closely spaced, rounded hills a few kilometers across; graded into etched unit of plateau sequence. Most of unit underlies Dorsa Argentea Formation. Interpretation: Plateau sequence and basement rocks; pitting and degradation caused by removal of ground ice, mass-wasting, and eolian exhumation of poorly consolidated material.</edomvd>

Interpretation: Possibly consists of lava flows erupted from fissures and small volcanoes or of alluvial or eolian deposits. Mottled appearance due to contast between generally low albedo of plains and brightness of small hills and impact-crater aprons. I-1802-B: Major occurrence north of map boundary (Tanaka and Scott, 1986); extends as far south as about lat 43&#194;&#176; N. Crater-ejecta blnakets have higher albedo than adjacent terrain, giving mottled appearance. In places, gently rolling, closely spaced hills averaging 5 km in diameter can be distinguished. Type area: lat 55&#194;&#176; N.., long 40&#194;&#176; (Scott and Tanaka, 1986). Interpretation: Possibly lava flows erupted from fissures, or of alluvial or eolian origin. I-1802-C (north pole): Characterized by high-albedo crater deposits superposed on low-albedo, smooth-plains deposits; occurs along more than half of edge of map area; gradational with other members, particularly knobby member. Interpretation: Lava flows, possibly erupted from fissures and small volcanoes, or alluvial or eolian deposits. Mottled appearance due to either fresh, light-colored material exposed during impact-crater excavation or to high-albedo eolian deposits trapped within crater ejecta.</edomvd>

Crater ejecta have albedo similar to that of surrounding terrain. Type area: lat 55&#194;&#176;N., long 5&#194;&#176; (Scott and Tanaka, 1986). Interpretation: Plains of diverse origins (volcanic flows, eolian mantles); hills may be small volcanoes, remnants of highland terrain or of crater rims, or pingos. I-1802-C: Characterized by abundant, kilometer-size, dark, knoblike hills spaced generally a few kilometers apart and commonly grouped into linear chains. Occurs in broad circumpolar help; interknob areas gradational with mottled and ridged members.

        <horizpar>The final digital product presented herein was adapted from the scanned linework of the original I-1802 maps. These original scans used outdated Martian geodesy, resulting in inaccurately placed contacts and structures. For the digital product presented herein, we used Viking Orbiter digital image mosaics and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) dataset [Smith et al. 2001] as basemaps to correctly align geologic contacts and structural symbols by hand in ArcGIS. The digital lines were drawn at approximately 1:2M scale with a node spacing of approximately 1 km. This digitized linework was intersected and cleaned by hand, using both smoothing algorithms (tolerance = 20 km) and generalizing algorithms (tolerance = 0.250 km). These efforts attempted to balance digital information, accuracy, and map aesthetics.</horizpar>
